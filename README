http://lithe-php.org/


Lithe is a lightweight web application framework for PHP. This is a template
for a multiple site application.


INSTALLATION

To get started, copy .htaccess.example to .htaccess in both the root folder
and in the sites/main/docroot/ folder.

Beyond that, the default Lithe configuration should be sufficient to run the
simple demo application.
